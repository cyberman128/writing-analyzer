This is a growing collection of my attempts at a repeat word counter for a text file. The idea came when I was editing my work in batches. My mindframe
is similar during each editing session however I've noticed I have a tendency to reuse words, especially adjectives, within uncomfortable proximity to each other.

"The table was gross. I put my hand on it and it was gross."

This is an incredibly simple example, but it shows the principle of my issue.

My goal is to show my progress by adding functionality to my idea with each new version. Each set of code will run on its own, stand alone.

The eventual goal is a programthat will analyze a page range in a document and provide a unique word count. In addtion, I'd like to find a
way to track various conjugations and permutations of words.

incrdible
incredibly

Both versions of the word incredible should feed into the same entry on my individual words list.

Also, I want to filter out filler words like the, he, she, they, a, as, of, etc.
